          %h1 Effective: April 2018
          %p Before you register with #{@settings.business_name}, you must read and agree to this Terms of Service ("TOS"). By using the #{@settings.business_name} services (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by the TOS and you agree that it is enforceable as if it were a written negotiated agreement signed by #{@settings.business_name} and you.
          %p These Customer Terms of Service (the "Customer Terms") describe your rights and responsibilities when using our WiFi Marketing Platform (the "Services"). Please read them carefully. If you are a Customer (defined below), these Customer Terms govern your access and use of our Services. If you are using a WiFi Hotspot set up and operated by a Customer, the User Terms of Service (the "User Terms") govern your access and use of the Services.
          %h1 Who is a customer?
          %p "Customer" is the organization that you represent in agreeing to the Contract. If your #{@settings.business_name} dashboard is being set up by someone who is not formally affiliated with an organization, Customer is the individual creating the dashboard. For example, if you signed up using a personal email address but haven't formed a company yet, you are the Customer.
          %h3 The Legal Bits
          %p This TOS, is an agreement you must accept in order to use #{@settings.business_name}'s Service (as defined below). It is applicable to (a) "Owners" -- this includes Primary Owners who initially set up the Service and other Owners that are granted ownership privileges by the Primary Owner; (b) Administrators – those who manage and run a location, project or brand, or group ("Administrators") (Owners and Administrators, collectively "Administrative Users"), and to c) Members – users who are invited to join an existing dashboard that has already been created in the Service by an Administrator ("Members"). The terms "you" and "users" encompass all users, including both Administrative Users and Members. This document describes both your rights and your obligations as part of using the Service. It is important that you read it carefully because you will be legally bound to these terms. #{@settings.business_name} only provides its Service (as defined below) to you subject to this TOS. By accepting this TOS or by accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by this TOS (including the Privacy Policy, which is incorporated here by reference).
          %p If you are entering into this TOS on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its Members, its Administrative Users, and its affiliates to this TOS. In that case, the terms "you" or "your" shall also refer to such entity, its Members, its Administrative Users, and its affiliates, as applicable. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this TOS, you may not use the Service. You acknowledge that this TOS is a contract between you and #{@settings.business_name}, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and #{@settings.business_name}, and it governs your use of the Service.
          %h3 Modification
          %p As our business evolves, we may change these Customer Terms and the other components of the Contract (except any Order Forms). If we make a material change to the Contract, we will provide Customer with reasonable notice prior to the change taking effect by emailing the email address associated with Customer's account. Customer can review the most current version of the Customer Terms at any time by visiting this page and by visiting the most current versions of the other pages that are referenced in the Contract. The materially revised Contract will become effective on the date set forth in our notice, and all other changes will become effective upon posting of the change. If Customer (or any Authorized User) accesses or uses the Services after the effective date, that use will constitute Customer's acceptance of any revised terms and conditions.
          %p #{@settings.business_name} may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise the TOS and subscriptions at any time without notice to you, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions.
