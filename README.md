# MIMO API!

Running in development. Make sure you have Docker, Git and Docker Compose installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/mimolabs/mimo-api.git
cd mimo-api
docker-compose up
```

Update your hosts file

```
vi /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       mimo.api
127.0.0.1       mimo.dashboard
```

### Update your client ID and secret

You'll need to update some variables in the MIMO frontend if you're hitting the api from your local machine.

In a terminal (within this folder):

```
docker-compose run api rails c
d = Doorkeeper::Application.first
d.uid
d.secret
```

Update server/config/local.env.sample.js and insert those variables around line 47.

A username and password will have been generated for you when you ran docker-compose up. They can be found in the log.

### Default User ###

The default user is user@mimo.com. If you want to change this:

```
docker-compose run api rails c
u = User.first
u.update email: my-email@bla.com, password: 123123123, password_confirmation: 123123123
```

DO NOT USE LIKE THIS IN PRODUCTION
